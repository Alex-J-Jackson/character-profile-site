                <blockquote>
                    <p>Bertram Wilberforce "Bertie" Wooster is a recurring fictional character 
                        in the Jeeves novels of British author P. G. Wodehouse. 
                        An English gentleman, one of the "idle rich", 
                        he appears alongside his valet, Jeeves, whose intelligence manages to save 
                        Wooster or one of his friends from numerous awkward situations. 
                        As the first-person narrator of ten novels and over 30 short stories, 
                        Wooster ranks as one of the most vivid comic creations in popular literature. 
                        His middle name, "Wilberforce", is the doing of his father, who won money on a 
                        horse named Wilberforce in the Grand National the day before Bertie was born and 
                        insisted on his son carrying that name (mentioned in Much Obliged, Jeeves).</p>
